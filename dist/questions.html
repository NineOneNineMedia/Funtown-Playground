        <b><span class="txt-primary">DELIVERY</span></b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Delivery is free within 20 miles of Lake Wylie, SC (zip code 29710). We can
        and will deliver outside of this 20-mile radius, however mileage fees will be
        assessed. We set up and break down play equipment for you. Our set-up and
        removal of the equipment will take about 30min-1hr (depending on a package
        size); this is not included in your booked time and is free of charge. We
        will need easy access to your party location prior to your event’s start
        time.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <b><span class="txt-fifth">RENTAL PERIOD</span></b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Each package provides four hours of rental period. Please let us know if you
        need to rent our equipment for a longer period of time. One additional hour
        is $70, two additional hours are $120.
      </p>
      <p>Contact us for full-day rates.</p>
      <h3>
        <b><span class="txt-secondary">BOOKING & PAYMENT</span></b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Click on “Reserve now” and fill out the form. We will contact you within
        24-48 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        We request a $100 deposit to reserve your date. If the equipment is returned
        in an extremely dirty condition at the time of pick up, we will charge a $50
        dollar cleaning fee.
      </p>
      <p>No booking will be confirmed until the deposit is received in full.</p>
      <p>
        Remaining balance will be due one day prior to the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will receive an invoice via email. You can pay via credit/debit card or
        paypal.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <b><span class="txt-tertiary">CANCELLATION</span></b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Cancellations made 7 days prior to the event will result in the loss of the
        $100 deposit.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <b><span class="txt-quarternary">OUTDOOR USE</span></b>
      </h3>
      <p>Yes, we do set up outdoors.</p>
      <p>The area must be flat, dry, clean and free of rocks.</p>
      <p>We do not set up on dirt or sand.</p>
      <p>
        Your child's safety is our number one priority. If the weather gets too hot
        (over 80 degrees) and the equipment is in direct sun, we highly recommend a
        shaded area or a canopy to avoid the equipment getting too hot. Ask about our
        canopy rentals!
      </p>
      <p>
        If it rains, we will not set up outside. Please have a back up plan for
        indoor use prior to the event. If the equipment can’t be set up due to rain,
        we can move the reservation to another day, free of additional charges!
      </p>
      <h3>
        <b><span class="txt-primary">INDOOR USE</span></b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        We do set up indoors. If you have limited space, we can make special
        arrangements for you. Just give us your requirements and we will make it
        work!
      </p>
      <p>
        Special instructions and other restrictions (stairs, elevators, limited
        parking) must be disclosed in advance before your party date so that we can
        plan for them.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <b><span class="txt-tertiary">INSURANCE</span></b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        We do carry general liability insurance. However, we still require our
        clients to sign a release of liability form before the play area is set up.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <b><span class="txt-fifth">SANITATION</span></b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Clean and germ-free equipment is our top priority to help keep your children
        safe and healthy. We have a strict cleaning and disinfecting routine after
        each rental. All equipment is again sanitized after set up. We use kid
        friendly cleaning supplies.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <b><span class="txt-secondary">RULES OF EQUIPMENT USE</span></b>
      </h3>
